"""Test actions in file listings that are not related to specific file operations

Some actions cannot be easily tested here:
- `o` opens current directory (not the highlighted row) in an OS file manager
- `enter` on a file opens it in a default associated OS application,
  but `enter` on an executable file does nothing
- ctrl+@ replaces -- DIR -- with ... first, then with dir size once computed
- ctrp+p opens a command palette where common list and app actions are present
  (ordering, hidden toggle, etc.)

TODO: test other commands that have no bindings
